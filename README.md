# eShop

Aplication which allow sell own product.

## Limitations/Problem

In this application I want to deliver complete product, I not sure if I can do it in only 100 days, but I will try.
The reason is that during implementation I will get to know different technologies better.

## Architecture / Component

In this app I want to based on:
- Blazor,
- MinAPI,
- Docker,
- MongoDb,
- RabbitMQ,

I will certainly rely to some extent on: https://github.com/dotnet/eShop

Oter topic:
- GraphQL,
- Github Action,
- CI/CD by Github,

## Plans

For first 10 days:
- Prepare list of issues which are necessary to implents,
- Prepare sketch/image with architecture,
- Extend Readme,
