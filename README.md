## Limitations/Problem

In this application I want to deliver complete product, I not sure if I can do it in only 100 days, but I will try.
The reason is that during implementation I will get to know different technologies better.

## Architecture / Component

In this app I want to based on:
- Blazor WASM,
- MinAPI,
- Docker,
- MongoDb,
- RabbitMQ,

I will certainly rely to some extent on: https://github.com/dotnet/eShop

Oter topic:
- GraphQL,
- Github Action,
- CI/CD by Github,
- Redis,

## Plans

For 20-30 days:
- work with frontend with Authorization,
- work with Prodcuts for front,
